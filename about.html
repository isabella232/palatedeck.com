  	<p>Understanding beer helps you appreciate the great ones even more. The Palate Desk makes learning about the beer you're drinking, <em>any beer</em>, easy and fun.</p>

		<h2 class="header-primary">What It Is</h2>

		<p>The Palate Deck is a set of cards that fuel your conversation while drinking beer. You and up to 3 other people play the cards featuring common flavors and sensations that match what you're tasting. More than just playing cards though, it’s an in-depth beer education that even tells you <em>why</em> you're experiencing certain flavors and sensations in any beer.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>The cards in the Palate Deck start with common aromatic and culinary cues that you're already familiar with. You match these to the flavors and sensations you find in the beer you're drinking.</p>
				</div>
			</li>

			<li class="faux-carousel-pane" data-next="How do they relate?">
				<div class="image">
					<a href="/images/howto-2.png" class="image-zoom">
						<img src="/images/howto-2.png" alt="Cards with the words Hoppy, Floral, Fruity">
					</a>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>So let's say you're drinking a tasty new IPA. Chances are you're noticing a few things about how it smells and tastes. It's hoppy, of course, and maybe you're picking up some other sensations like fruit or floral notes.</p>
				</div>
			</li>

			<li class="faux-carousel-pane" data-next="How does it look?">
				<div class="image">
					<a href="/images/howto-3.png" class="image-zoom">
						<img src="/images/howto-3.png" alt="The same cards, with the addition of Evaluation cards saying Appearance, Aroma, and Taste">
					</a>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>The guide cards let you easily show relationships too. Maybe what you're smelling is unmistakably floral, but what you're tasting is more hoppy and fruity. So you play the cards where they best fit.</p>
				</div>

			<li class="faux-carousel-pane" data-next="What else did you notice?">

					</a>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>As the saying goes, we eat with our eyes. And we drink with them too, so how the beer looks is important. This was a very clear beer, and the color seems more deep gold than yellow.</p>
				</div>

						<img src="/images/howto-5.png" alt="The same cards, with the addition of Citrus, Tropical Fruit and Pine cards">
					</a>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>You may have found more specific character in this beer. Perhaps the fruit character is more disctinctly tropical, with some citrus notes. Maybe you even get some pine.</p>

					</a>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>And you might even be able to talk about how strong or weak of each of these tastes and smells are. The pine isn't that prominent, but the tropical fruit sure is, and the hops are noticeably citrus-like.</p>

					<p>This progressive evaluation style allows you to stop at any stage along the way. You only have to go as far as you're comfortable when tasting and describing the beer you're drinking.</p>
					<p>And that's what the Palate Deck is all about. Casual, easy beer tasting that you can conduct at your own pace.</p>
