				<p>Next time you're enjoying a casual beer with friends, use the Palate Deck as your expert-level guide to learn more about what you're drinking.</p>
				<p>Because it's split into two difficulty levels, you can choose simpler gameplay for casual sessions, or a more in-depth tasting experience if you're really looking to get to the bottom of your beer, so to speak.</p>

		<p>Kick off the conversation while sampling a flight at your nearby brewery or enjoying pints with friends. With just a few square feet of free table space, you can easily play a round or two wherever you enjoy great beer.</p>

		<p>And if you work for a brewery or taproom, having copies of the Palate Deck available for your customers is a great way to allow them to explore the world of beer at their own pace or during brewery tours.</p>
