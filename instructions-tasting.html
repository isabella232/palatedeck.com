		<p>The Palate Deck aims to spark conversation and help everyone who uses it understand their beer a little better. Here are some guidelines to follow, whether this is your first time evaluating a beer or you’re an experienced judge.</p>

		<p><strong>The main goal:</strong> whether you’re playing competitively or conducting a collaborative tasting session, your goal is to build the best tasting profile of a beer that you can through conversation and consensus.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Conversation is key! You may not be comfortable talking about what you’re tasting. You may not be able to find a great word for what you’re tasting, or a good reason to play a particular card, beyond your instincts. You may even be worried you’ll say something others won’t agree with. That’s completely natural for many people, especially at first.</li> 

			<li>It’s important to remember that tasting is subjective, and there are no universal rights or wrongs. It’s okay if you taste something that others don’t. The Palate Deck only works when discussion happens so it’s always worth taking a chance, even on words you’re not quite sure about.</li>

			<li>Find Tasting Words that best match the beer you’re sampling. When each card is played, there should be a discussion along with it about why it may or may not be a good fit.</li>

			<li>If the card’s tasting hints offer more context, or more specific wording for what you’re experiencing or tasting, talk about those.</li>

			<li>If you play a card that you’re able to explain in more detail, attempt to be as specific as you can. For example when you play the Fruit Family card, try and describe which fruit you’re tasting. Is it more of a red berry, or is it closer to a peachy stone fruit?</li>

			<li>Not everything can be specific though. Sometimes you’re only able to pinpoint that a floral quality is present, without the ability to name a specific flower. That’s perfectly okay.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="header-secondary">Dealing with Conflicts</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>If the Tasting Word matches the beer but the tasting hints don’t, feel free to play the card anyway. <strong>Example:</strong> Lucy played Roasted, but the roast character doesn’t seem to match any of the specific tastes in the tasting hints. Roasted is still a valid play, if others agree.</li>

			<li>If words in the tasting hints match the beer but the Tasting Word itself doesn’t, don’t play the card. <strong>Example:</strong> Mike played Nutty because Granola is listed in the tasting hints, but the beer doesn’t actually have a truly nutty character. Playing Nutty would not be valid.</li>

			<li>Disagreement is inevitable, and even healthy. When it occurs, go with the majority opinion. Even if it’s a slim majority. <strong>Example:</strong> Alice played the Sweet Family card, but I think this beer is more fruity than sweet. Luis agreed with me, so we decided to discard Sweet.</li>

			<li>When a Tasting Word applies to multiple Evaluation cards, either place it between them to show the overlap, or if that’s not possible, choose the strongest match and play it there. <strong>Example:</strong> This is a highly carbonated beer, which shows in both Appearance and Mouthfeel. It’s a smoother carbonation though, so we played the Carbonated card on Appearance.</li>

			<li>When Tasting Words from different flavor families describe a similar character, it’s fine to play both in an overlapping manner. The Family cards create a basic categorization of flavors, but many of the Tasting Words could easily exist in other Families too so they shouldn’t be considered rigid. <strong>Example:</strong> Rachel played Sour earlier, but I have the Grapefruit card and we agree it is somewhat acidic but exhibits more grapefruit-like flavor and bitterness, so I play Grapefruit over top of Acidic to show the two are connected.</li>
