      <p>The Palate Deck is new type of beer education tool, currently under development. It&#8217;s a set of playing cards that casually teaches anyone how to understand and evaluate beer like a pro, using common culinary terms they&#8217;re already familiar with from other food and drink.</p>

    <h2 class="header-sub">Why The Palate Deck?</h2>

    <p>There has never been more interest in great beer, or more people talking about what they're tasting while sampling it. Existing beer education often uses tastes and smells as a means to explain styles, ingredients and off-flavors.</p>

      <img class="box" src="/images/illustration-box2.png" alt="">
    </a>

    <p>But why not approach that from the other direction too? What if there were beer education tools that <strong>started</strong> with the flavors and the aromas themselves, and connected those more accessible culinary terms to beer styles, ingredients and process?</p>

    <p>Once they start recognizing familiar sensations in their favorite beers, even those new to tasting may be encouraged to reach the next level in their beer understanding. And that's the Palate Deck.</p>

      <h2 class="header-primary">How it Works</h2>

      <p>The Palate Deck is a series of card decks that offer multiple levels of gameplay and beer evaluation tools. A player starts with culinary terms they're already familiar with and uses those to match flavors and sensations they're experiencing in a beer.</p>

      <p>At higher levels, more evaluation options and expanded gameplay get to the heart of a beer's profile. Regardless of the player's knowledge level, this staged approach will help them quickly level up their tasting and evaluation ability.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <h3 class="header-small">Using the Palate Deck</h3>
      <p>In its most basic form, the Palate Deck encourages conversation between players by having them taste beer and collaboratively build a visual profile of what they're tasting by matching Tasting Cards to each of the evaluation criteria. The reduced single-deck card set and tasting tools are designed to make beer evaluation accessible, and encourage those with no past experience to give it a try.</p>

          <img src="/images/illustration-level1.png" alt="The Palate Deck Tutorial">
        </a>
        <figcaption><strong>Tutorial mode</strong> &#8212; their first time using the Palate Deck, players will be asked to create a very simple visual tasting layout.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <p>In advanced rounds, players use a second card deck to comment on the intensity of each sensation, which builds a more complex visual grid to represent the character of the beer they're sampling.</p>

      <figure class="preview-example">
        <a href="/images/illustration-level2.png" class="image-zoom">
          <img src="/images/illustration-level2.png" alt="Advanced Usage">
        </a>
        <figcaption><strong>Advanced mode</strong> &#8212; when familiar with basic beer evaluation, players go into more detail with a larger tasting grid.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <p>In many ways, the cards are really just a mechanism to spark conversation, which is the real goal. The design intentionally suggests similar tastes and experiences to add new ideas and vocabulary to the discussion. If they spark healthy debate over nuances of a beer, they have succeeded; the purpose isn't to be correct, it's to find consensus. Tasting is subjective, after all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <h3 class="header-small">The Card Design</h3>

      <p>Each tasting card contains one primary word or phrase that drives gameplay. But in addition, it offers similar words that offer clarifying context, a technical description about why that flavor or sensation may be present in a beer, and basic information on categorization and frequency. <a href="/docs/tasting-cards.pdf">More detail</a> is available if you're curious.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <h3 class="header-small">First Edition</h3>

      <p>The first edition includes two decks of cards, Level I and Level II, with all the cards necessary for a few different styles of basic to intermediate gameplay and evaluation.</p>

      <ul class="card-list">

          </a>
          <h4 class="header-inline">Guide Cards</h4>
          <p>The four primary Guide cards are the basic traits used to organize the other cards in most game modes, and are the common aspects used in beer evaluation: Appearance, Aroma, Taste, and Mouthfeel</p>

          <p>Tasting Words that relate to the Family Cards, but cover more specific flavors and aromas.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>
    </div>



    <div class="page-sub-section">
      <h3 class="header-sub">Future Editions</h3>

      <p><strong>Second Edition</strong> &#8212; The second edition will offer two new card decks with more specific tasting options and includes Level III and Level IV decks. The Taste Evaluation card from the first edition will be broken into four distinct phases common in the wine world to allow for more nuanced beer evaluation: Initial, Mid-Palate, Finish, and Aftertaste. Extra beer color cards will allow more complete color evaluation, including tints attained from various additives. Tasting cards become far more specific, referring to character found in very few beers.</p>

      <p><strong>Sensory Edition</strong> &#8212; This edition reverses the card design of lower levels and replaces earlier cards by putting chemical compounds up front, and matches them to flavours. Paper becomes Trans 2 Nonenal, Pineapple becomes Ethyl Butyrate, Floral becomes Geraniol, and so on. This edition is for people who are studying beer in a more professional capacity.</p>

      <p><strong>Oddball Edition</strong> &#8212; provides a vocabulary for those strange, unexpected flavors and aromas that don't occur naturally in a beer. Everyone experiences this at some point: a strange character present in a beer that is undefinable, until someone comes up with an evocative flavor association that somehow fits that character perfectly. Some examples: Bicycle Tire, Bug Spray, Incense, Olive Oil, Potting Soil, etc.</p>
