		<strong>What is the Palate&nbsp;Deck?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The Palate Deck is a card game to help you conduct beer tasting sessions and tune your palate, for beginning and expert tasters&nbsp;alike.</p>
		<p>The idea behind it is that everyone already has experience with basic tastes and smells, thanks to the fact we’re conscious human beings who consume food and drink. Common culinary and beverage terms are the closest thing we have to a universal when it comes to describing what we taste, and these can absolutely be applied to&nbsp;beer.
		</p><p>What the Palate Deck provides is a starting point for learning more about your beer. It provides a structure for conversation and a cheat sheet for your beer vocabulary. On each card you’ll find a word, and a lot of ways of describing that word. Players consider these, discard the ones that don’t match, and talk about the ones you think might&nbsp;apply.
		</p><p>More than just playing cards though, it provides a more in-depth beer education. Every single card not only gives you a tasting word, it also tells you why that flavor or aroma might be present in the&nbsp;beer.</p>
	</dd>


	<dt>
		<strong>What’s included with the Palate&nbsp;Deck?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The Palate Deck core product is a twin set of 54-card playing card decks. It comes in a 6″ x 4″ x 1″ box with two instruction manuals, so it’s nice and portable for use at bars and tasting&nbsp;rooms.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>
		<strong>Who created the Palate&nbsp;Deck?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The Palate Deck was created by Dave Shea. Dave Shea is a Certified Cicerone® and BJCP-certified beer judge. He’s also a co-founder of Vancouver’s Farmhouse Fest Saison and Wild Ale Festival, and a long-time home brewer who finds the occasion to brew commercially every so often. Outside of beer, Dave&nbsp;is <a href="http://daveshea.com/about/">well&nbsp;known</a> in the web design &amp; development&nbsp;community.</p>
	</dd>



	<dt>
		<strong>How much will the Palate Deck&nbsp;cost?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>At the time of writing I’m still waiting on a couple of final manufacturing and shipping details to ensure the budget is realistic, but I’m targeting a $25-30 USD ($33-39 CAD) price&nbsp;point.</p>
	</dd>



	<dt>
		<strong>When will the Kickstarter funding campaign&nbsp;launch?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>The target right now is during first half of October, and I’m pretty sure I’ll hit&nbsp;it.</p>
	</dd>


	<dt>
		<strong>What was the inspiration behind the Palate&nbsp;Deck?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>I guess I’ve followed a pretty typical beer geek progression over the past ten years. I started homebrewing, then got my BJCP and Cicerone certifications, and ended up running a beer festival (Vancouver’s Farmhouse Fest). I’ll stop short of starting a brewery any time soon, but as someone with a product design background I saw an opportunity for a new type of beer tasting&nbsp;tool.</p>
		<p>There’s been a huge uptick in consumer interest about what’s in their pint glass and how it got there, which is really cool! It has also meant far more people talking about what they’re tasting, whether it’s in person over flights or at festivals, online with beer rating apps and social media, or wherever&nbsp;else.</p>

		<p>Sometimes these conversations could benefit from the guidance a tasting reference would provide, but learning more about your beer means being the kind of person who will invest the money — and maybe more importantly, the time — in some of the great books and courses out there. Not everyone is going to&nbsp;bother.</p>
		<p>Instead of committing to more extended study, what if there was a way to casually learn a little bit while sipping through a flight? And that was the main goal of the Palate Deck: to provide a casual tool for informal learning that allows you to play a single round within 10-15 minutes, and maybe learn a little about your beer and your tastes in the&nbsp;process.</p>
		<p>A few other goals were designing the deck to be progressive so that you could start with little to no tasting experience and quickly level up, as well as making sure it was portable so you could easily take with you and lay out on a table in a tasting&nbsp;room.</p>
		<p>And I also noticed during the design phase that almost all existing beer education uses flavours and aromas as a means to explain styles, ingredients and off-flavours, but treats them maybe as more of a side-effect than the primary focus. But I think there’s room to approach that from the other direction, too. By putting beer flavours and the aromas first, the Palate Deck starts with how we typically talk about and describe beer, and then connects those more accessible culinary terms to beer styles, ingredients and&nbsp;process.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>
		<strong>Who is your target&nbsp;audience?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Before launching I’ve already seen plenty of interest from casual beer fans, so in some senses anyone who likes good beer could be a potential user of the Palate&nbsp;Deck.</p>
		<p>But that’s an awfully broad market, so for the Kickstarter I’ll be focusing on getting the word out to professionals in the beer industry, and related amateur&nbsp;interest:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bar and restaurant&nbsp;staff</li>
			<li>Brewery tasting&nbsp;rooms</li>
			<li>Beer&nbsp;distributors</li>
			<li>Aspiring beer judges and&nbsp;Cicerones</li>
			<li>Home&nbsp;brewers</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Of course, I’ll happily sell it to anyone who’s&nbsp;interested!</p>
	</dd>

		<strong>How will you measure&nbsp;success?</strong>

		<p>In a way, Kickstarter makes that simple: hit your funding goal, and you’re&nbsp;successful.</p>
		<p>I’d like to do better than that, however, as I have plans for follow-up sets that will rely on a certain amount of funding to consider producing. For example, I’ve already planned out most of an expansion set that will include two more extended card decks. I’m hoping to offer that as a stretch goal to help ensure successful&nbsp;funding.</p>
		<p>And you might have noticed that the name itself doesn’t actually have anything to do with beer; that was intentional. If beer works out, I can see producing sets for other beverages and even food. I’d consider this project a success if I find myself working on a follow-up Palate Deck that doesn’t involve beer next&nbsp;year.</p>

		<strong>What are your plans to export the Palate&nbsp;Deck?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Absolutely. I’m focusing my marketing on North America during the Kickstarter, but I have a fulfillment partner that offers warehousing and shipping almost anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p>
