        <title>Palate Deck vs. Samuel Smith</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The days are getting shorter and the temperature is dropping, which is a great time of year to get back into the darker beers. Continuing the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/11/01/findumonde.html&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of Palate Deck action shots, let&#39;s take a look at Samuel Smith&#39;s Taddy Porter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Yorkshire brew is a classic English porter with fruity roasty flavor and a clean dry finish. Thanks to some nuanced malt character, there are plenty of subtleties that advanced Palate Deck sessions can help draw out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the basic tasting mode again, this time we only have a few cards we can play. With a notably brown color and light malty sweetness, there are hints of fruit but those are the only cards that match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/images/all-ks-updates/taddy-porter/1.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/usage-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taddy Porter with 5 very basic cards played&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simpler gameplay modes don&#39;t allow enough nuance to adequately describe a beer. Lucky for us, it&#39;s not hard to go further. With the extended tasting cards we can build up a better picture of this beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malt character comes across in a few ways. The sweetness suggests caramel and chocolate, while there&#39;s a disctinct nuttiness in the flavor. Light berry notes are perceived on the aroma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/images/all-ks-updates/taddy-porter/3.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/usage-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;With the intensity scale we can quantify all these flavours, and start describing the complex mouthfeel. A rounded creaminess is noticeable, and on the finish this beer goes quite dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you&#39;ve never had it, the cards below give a much better idea of which flavors and sensations you might expect to come across in Samuel Smith&#39;s Taddy Porter.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/usage-8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A more detailed evaluation with many specific cards and the intensity scale cards played.&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With 108 cards, the two decks provide a lot of nuance and detail. They don’t cover every situation however, so stay tuned for a future update where I shed some light on the Second Edition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Using the Palate Deck</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting familiar with how you use the Palate Deck requires trying some beer, so let&#39;s walk through a widely-available beer to get a feel for how using it to evaluate that beer works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll start with a Quebec beer that is well known throughout the world, Unibroue’s Fin du Monde. This flavorful Belgian-style tripel is packed with fruit and spice, and carries some serious weight at 9% ABV. Its complexity makes it a great way to show off how the Palate Deck can adapt to your experience level with beer tasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a very basic tasting mode. If you (or friends you’re sampling with) are new to beer tasting, you can keep it simple and focus on generals without getting wrapped up in specifics. Pull out the color cards and the Tasting Family cards (20 cards in total) and simply play the ones that match the beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/images/all-ks-updates/findumonde/1.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/usage-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fin du Monde with 6 very basic cards played&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fin du Monde is a hazy golden color, and the spicy fruity notes are prominent along with some sweet flavor and a noticeable alcohol character. You might only be able to match 3 or 4 cards, but maybe you’ll find 7 or 8 that match; either result is okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may be as far as you want to go, and that’s enough to get a feel for what the Palate Deck can offer. But you may also notice during the conversation that you naturally gravitate toward breaking it down further.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;a href=&quot;/images/all-ks-updates/findumonde/2.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/usage-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fin du Monde now with three evaluation cards and some attributes&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned Fin du Monde was hazy, and conveniently there’s a card for that. It’s also a frothy beer when first poured, with big carbonation that almost pushes the cork straight out of the bottle as soon as you remove the wire cage on top. Combine those two attributes with the golden color, and we can start marking out how this beer looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the sweetness and the alcohol presence are primarily noticed while tasting, but the fruit and spice notes come out strong as soon as the bottle is opened. By forming columns and aligning the tasting cards with the evaluation cards, I can start building up a better picture of how this beer tastes.Since there are clarifying tasting notes printed on each of the family cards, what commonly happens is that you’ll find your group picking out more specific aromas and flavors from the cards that help describe the beer in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/images/all-ks-updates/findumonde/3.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/usage-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The same evaluation setup as the previous image, with a few more specific cards&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;So in this case, I was able to identify the spicy character as pepper, and the fruit as being a split between stone fruit and citrus. Additionally, the sweetness struck me as leaning slightly in a vanilla direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re comfortable with describing beer to this level of detail, the second deck of cards gives you even more evaluation tools and the ability to dive into a huge variety of specific tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/images/all-ks-updates/findumonde/4.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/usage-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A more detailed evaluation with many specific cards and the intensity scale cards played.&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;By using the intensity scale I can show whether I’m perceiving something as light or strong. I can also start describing the physical sensation of the beer, known as mouthfeel. And with more specific tasting cards, I can call out that stone fruit character as being peach-like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 108 cards, the two decks provide a lot of nuance and detail. They don’t cover every situation however, so stay tuned for a future update where I shed some light on the Second Edition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Many Aromas of Hops</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;/images/photo-pd-hops.jpg&quot; class=&quot;blog-photo&quot; alt=&quot;Fresh hops&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How well do you know your hops? Maybe you&#39;re already familiar with the citrusy flavor of west coast hops, or the more floral spicy notes of traditional European Noble Hops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where do you turn when you encounter slightly less obvious hop character like peach or anise? Here’s a brand new &lt;a href=&quot;/tasting/hops&quot;&gt;guide to hop varieties&lt;/a&gt;, sorted by flavors and aromas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing the Palate Deck</title>
        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;/images/photo-pd-intro.jpg&quot; class=&quot;blog-photo&quot; alt=&quot;Hand holding Palate Deck Cards&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re out having pints of your favorite local IPA, and for some reason it tastes a lot sharper and rougher than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, maybe you&#39;re splitting a bottle of saison with a few friends and you&#39;ve all noticed a distinct spiciness you&#39;re all trying to find the right word to describe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps you&#39;re sampling your way through a flight at a new local brewery, and there&#39;s something not quite right about their golden ale... but you can&#39;t put your finger on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve all had beer-drinking experiences like these. Maybe you&#39;ll get lucky and have a knowledgeable server who can help you diagnose what you&#39;re tasting, but when you&#39;re on your own how do you get to the bottom of your pint glass, so to speak?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading-secondary&quot;&gt;Learning Beer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I barely need to mention how popular craft beer is right now. People care about what they&#39;re eating and drinking more than ever, and they want to drink better beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those same people are increasingly interested in having a basic literacy of the flavors and aromas they&#39;re experiencing in various beer styles. The problem is that there&#39;s not much out there to help you understand what you&#39;re tasting when you drink.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s true that many existing beer books and courses are geared toward the brewing process, beer history, and the ingredients you&#39;d use when making beer. But where do you turn if you want to start with the flavors in your glass &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the Palate Deck is about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading-secondary&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone already knows plenty about culinary and beverage terms for basic tastes and smells, thanks to the fact we&#39;re conscious humans who consume food and drink. These are the closest thing we have to a universal when it comes to describing what we taste, and they can absolutely be applied to beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;blog-image-right&quot; src=&quot;/images/cards-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cards with the words Hoppy, Floral, Fruity&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the Palate Deck offers is a starting point. It creates a structure for your conversation and a cheat sheet for your beer vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On each card you&#39;ll find a word, and a lot of ways of describing that word. Players consider these, discard the ones that don&#39;t match, and talk about the ones they think might apply. You match terms you&#39;re already familiar with to the beer you&#39;re drinking, which allows you to learn more about both your beer and your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;more to it&lt;/a&gt; of course, but that&#39;s the quick summary of how it works.  And if you really want to know what&#39;s causing something in your beer, there&#39;s extra information on each card to give you some context about why you&#39;re experiencing that flavor or aroma.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading-secondary&quot;&gt;Who&#39;s behind it?&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media-caption&quot;&gt;
  		&lt;p&gt;Hi, I’m &lt;a href=&quot;http://daveshea.com/&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve spent almost 20 years in the technology world, but outside of my day job I’ve been interested in the beer industry for a long while now.&lt;/p&gt;

  		&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been homebrewing since 2010 and I&#39;ve had the opportunity to brew commercially a few times. I run the annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://farmhousefest.com/&quot;&gt;Farmhouse Fest&lt;/a&gt; beer festival in Vancouver, and over the past couple of years I’ve become a Certified BJCP beer judge and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/users/dave-shea-0&quot;&gt;Certified Cicerone®&lt;/a&gt;, which are things you probably don&#39;t care about unless you&#39;re in the beer industry, but trust me they&#39;re pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading-secondary&quot;&gt;When can you buy it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll get your first chance to buy the Palate Deck when the Kickstarter campaign launches during the first two weeks of October. Follow along on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thepalatedeck&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/palatedeck&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to hear about it, or &lt;a href=&quot;/buy/&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; for a one-time email when the campaign goes live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;img src=&quot;/images/photo-alibi2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;blog-photo&quot; alt=&quot;Different beer glassware&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beer glassware is one of those subjects that many will roll their eyes at, and with good reason. Six-packs comes in convenient serving-size portions with everything you need to drink the beer built in. Open the can or bottle, and there is no step 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But&amp;#8230; what you drink beer from &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; matter. Beer-focused bars offer a variety of glasses to accentuate the appearance and aromatics of a beer. Doesn&#39;t it seem just a little bit nicer when your beer comes in a stemmed glass instead of your standard pint glass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your beer is in the right glass, it can help open up subtleties that you may not have noticed in any other glass. If you&#39;d like to learn more about how this works, well good news, there&#39;s now a guide for that in the &lt;a href=&quot;/tasting/&quot;&gt;Tasting Library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pilsners, pale ales, stouts, saisons and lambics. There are hundreds of historical beer styles, not to mention the way modern breweries are evolving those and creating new ones all the time. Navigating beer styles can be tough without a guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve ever been curious about the difference between a stout and a porter, or have never been quite sure what imperial means, there&#39;s help at hand. All these and more can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;/tasting/beer-styles/&quot;&gt;Beer Styles&lt;/a&gt; reference, a new permanent addition to the &lt;a href=&quot;/tasting/&quot;&gt;Tasting Library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
