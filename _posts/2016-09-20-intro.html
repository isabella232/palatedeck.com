<p>Having a pint of your favorite local IPA and finding that it tastes fruitier than usual. Splitting a bottle of saison with a friend or two and trying to find the right word to describe the spiciness you're all noticing. Trying flights at a new local brewery and noticing there's something not quite right about their golden ale, but you can't put your finger on it.</p>

<p>Does any of that sound familiar?</p>

<p>I probably don't need to tell you how popular craft beer is. People care about what they're drinking more than ever, and want to drink better beer. And those same people are increasingly interested in having a basic literacy of the flavors and aromas they're experiencing in various beer styles.</p>

<p>The problem is that not much out there helps you understand what you're tasting when you drink beer, or at least doesn't focus on flavor first and forefront. A lot existing beer education is geared more toward the brewing process and ingredients you'd use when making beer.</p>

<p>While a deeper understanding of beer is important if you want to take your knowledge to a deeper level, it doesn't work for the average person who just wants to drink beer and learn a bit more about it.</p>

<p>This is who the Palate Deck is for.</p>

<p>The premise behind the Palate Deck is that everyone already has some experience describing basic tastes and smells thanks to the fact they're conscious human beings that consume food and drink. Common culinary and beverage terms are the closest thing we have to a universal when it comes to describing what we taste, and these can absolutely be applied to beer.</p>

<p>What the Palate Deck provides is a starting point. It's a framework for conversation and a cheat sheet for vocabulary. On each card is printed a word, and a lot of ways of describing that word. Players consider these and talk about the ones they think might apply.</p>

<p>There's a little more structure than that, but that's basically what it's about. By matching terms you're already familiar with to the beer you're drinking, you can learn more about your beer, and yourself and your preferences. And if you really want to know what's causing something in your beer, there's even some extra information on each card to give you some brewing context about why you're experiencing a flavor or aroma.</p>











<p>At long last, here it is. Either you've been following along on Twitter over the past six months, or you're hearing about it for the first time now. Either way, thanks for your interest!</p>

<p>Hi, I’m <a href="http://daveshea.com/">Dave</a>. I’ve spent almost 20 years in the technology world, but I’ve been fascinated with the beer industry as an extracurricular activity for a long while now.</p>

<p>I took up homebrewing 6 years ago, and I've had the opportunity to brew commercially a few times. I run the annual Farmhouse Fest beer festival in Vancouver, and over the past couple of years I’ve become a Certified BJCP beer judge (#A0966) and a <a href="https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/users/dave-shea-0">Certified Cicerone®</a>.</p>

stuff that probably isn't going anywhere

<p>The knowledge I’ve picked up while working on these various pursuits has been hard-earned, because beer education resources are largely targeted at industry professionals and people who brew. They’re technical, in-depth, and spend a lot of time on chemistry and specific compounds. It doesn’t have to be this way!</p>

something linking these two

    <p>There has never been more interest in great beer, or more people talking about what they're tasting while sampling it. Existing beer education often uses tastes and smells as a means to explain styles, ingredients and off-flavors.</p>

    <p>But why not approach that from the other direction too? What if there were beer education tools that <strong>started</strong> with the flavors and the aromas themselves, and connected those more accessible culinary terms to beer styles, ingredients and process?</p>

    <p>Once people start recognizing familiar sensations in their favorite beers, even those new to tasting can be encouraged to reach the next level in their beer understanding. And that's the Palate Deck.</p>
