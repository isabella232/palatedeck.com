<p>At long last, here it is. Either you've been following along on Twitter over the past six months, or you're hearing about it for the first time now. Either way, thanks for your interest!</p>

<p>Hi, I’m <a href="http://daveshea.com/">Dave</a>. I’ve spent almost 20 years in the technology world, but I’ve been fascinated with the beer industry as an extracurricular activity for a long while now.</p>

<p>I took up homebrewing 6 years ago, and I've had the opportunity to brew commercially a few times. I run the annual Farmhouse Fest beer festival in Vancouver, and over the past couple of years I’ve become a Certified BJCP beer judge (#A0966) and a <a href="https://www.cicerone.org/us-en/users/dave-shea-0">Certified Cicerone®</a>.</p>

shit that probably isn't going anywhere

<p>The knowledge I’ve picked up while working on these various pursuits has been hard-earned, because beer education resources are largely targeted at industry professionals and people who brew. They’re technical, in-depth, and spend a lot of time on chemistry and specific compounds. It doesn’t have to be this way!</p>

something linking these two

    <p>There has never been more interest in great beer, or more people talking about what they're tasting while sampling it. Existing beer education often uses tastes and smells as a means to explain styles, ingredients and off-flavors.</p>

    <p>But why not approach that from the other direction too? What if there were beer education tools that <strong>started</strong> with the flavors and the aromas themselves, and connected those more accessible culinary terms to beer styles, ingredients and process?</p>

    <p>Once people start recognizing familiar sensations in their favorite beers, even those new to tasting can be encouraged to reach the next level in their beer understanding. And that's the Palate Deck.</p>
