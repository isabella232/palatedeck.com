<p>The days are getting shorter and the temperature is dropping, which is a great time of year to get back into the darker beers. Continuing the <a href="/2016/11/01/findumonde.html">series</a> of Palate Deck action shots, let's take a look at Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter.</p>

<p>This Yorkshire brew is a classic English porter with fruity roasty flavor and a clean dry finish. Thanks to some nuanced malt character, there are plenty of subtleties that advanced Palate Deck sessions can help draw out.</p>

<p>Starting with the basic tasting mode again, this time we only have a few cards we can play. With a notably brown color and light malty sweetness, there are hints of fruit but those are the only cards that match.</p>

<p>Sometimes the simpler gameplay modes don't allow enough nuance to adequately describe a beer. Lucky for us, it's not hard to go further. With the extended tasting cards we can build up a better picture of this beer.</p>

<p>The malt character comes across in a few ways. The sweetness suggests caramel and chocolate, while there's a disctinct nuttiness in the flavor. Light berry notes are perceived on the aroma.</p>

<p>With the intensity scale we can quantify all these flavours, and start describing the complex mouthfeel. A rounded creaminess is noticeable, and on the finish this beer goes quite dry.</p>

<p>Even if you've never had it, the cards below give a much better idea of which flavors and sensations you might expect to come across in Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter.</p>

<p>With 108 cards, the two decks provide a lot of nuance and detail. They donâ€™t cover every situation however, so stay tuned for a future update where I shed some light on the Second Edition.</p>
