<p>Beer glassware is one of those subjects that many will roll their eyes at, and with good reason. Six-packs comes in convenient serving-size portions with everything you need to drink the beer built in. Open the can or bottle, and there is no step 2.</p>

<p>But&#8230; what you drink beer from <em>does</em> matter. Beer-focused bars offer a variety of glasses to accentuate the appearance and aromatics of a beer. Doesn't it seem just a little bit nicer when your beer comes in a stemmed glass instead of your standard pint glass?</p>

<p>When your beer is in the right glass, it can help open up subtleties that you may not have noticed in any other glass. If you'd like to learn more about how this works, well good news, there's now a guide for that in the <a href="/tasting/">Tasting Library</a>.</p>
